           <h4 className="pb-3" >Sharing Information with Affiliates and Other Third Parties</h4>
            <p>We do not sell or rent your PD to third-parties for marketing purposes. You understand, and we undertake, that we will provide your PD through our platform strictly to the corporate stakeholders that are using our platform. However, for data aggregation purposes we may use your non PD, which might be sold to other parties at our discretion. Any such data aggregation would not contain any of your PD. We may provide your PD to third-party service providers we hire to provide services to us. These third-party service providers may include but are not limited to: payment processors, web analytics companies, advertising networks, call centers, data management services, help desk providers, accountants, law firms, auditors, shopping cart and email service providers, and shipping companies.</p>

           <h4 className="pb-3">Retaining and Destroying Your PD</h4>
           <p>We only retain the personal information collected from a User for as long as the User’s account is active on our platform, or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law.
            <br/>
            In some cases, it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the 2-year criteria, after your relationship with us ends.
            <br/><br/>
            We may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

           <h4 className="pb-3" >California Privacy Rights</h4>
          <p>In addition to the rights provided for above, if you are a California or US resident, you have the right to request information from us regarding whether we share certain categories of your personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To the extent we share your personal information in this way, you may receive the following information: 
        <br/><span>(a) </span>the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; and

        <br/>
        <span>(b) </span> the names and addresses of third parties that received such information, or if the nature of their business cannot be determined from the name, then examples of the products or services marketed.
        </p>    
        <p className='pt-4'>Effective January 1st, 2020, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), California residents have certain rights in relation to their personal information, subject to limited exceptions. Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this California Privacy Rights section.
        </p> 

        <ul>
            <li>For personal information collected by us during the preceding 12 months that is not otherwise subject to an exception, California residents have the right to access and delete their personal information. Lonelyfans will not discriminate against those who exercise their rights. Specifically, if you exercise your rights, we will not deny you services, charge you different prices for services or provide you a different level or quality of services.</li>
            <li>To the extent we sell your personal information to third parties, you also have the right to request that we disclose to you: (i) the categories of your personal information that we sold, and (ii) the categories of third parties to whom your personal information was sold. You have the right to direct us not to sell your personal information. Lonelyfans does not sell your personal information in its ordinary course of business and will never sell your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent.
                <br/><br/>
                Should Lonelyfans engage in any of the activities listed in this section, your ability to exercise these rights will be made available to you in your account settings. You can exercise your rights by going contacting us via email so that we may consider your request.
                <br/><br/>
                If you are a US resident, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request to access or a request to delete on your behalf.  We will respond to your authorized agent's request if they submit proof that they are registered with the California Secretary of State to be able to act on your behalf, or submit evidence you have provided them with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code section 4000 to 4465. We may deny requests from authorized agents who do not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf, or are unable to verify their identity.

           <h4 className="pb-3">Transferring PD From the European Economic Area</h4>
           <p>PD that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate. The European Union and the UK has not found the United States and some other countries to have an adequate level of protection of PD under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. For European Union customers and users, with your consent, your PD may be transferred outside the European Union to the United States  and or other countries. We will use your PD to provide the services, and/or information you request from us to perform a contract with you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable steps to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using our website, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD described within this section.</p>

<br/><br/>Otherwise we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ PD in agreement with the privacy notice in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of our website, services, and products after any change to this privacy notice will constitute your acceptance of such change.
